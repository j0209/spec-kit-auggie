# Security Guidelines for Spec-Kit Projects

## üõ°Ô∏è **General Security Principles**

### **Security by Design**
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify threats early in the design phase
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
- **Fail Securely**: Ensure systems fail to a secure state
- **Privacy by Design**: Build privacy protection into systems from the start

### **Data Protection Fundamentals**
- **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
- **Encryption Standards**: Use AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Key Management**: Implement proper key rotation and secure key storage
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only necessary data
- **Secure Deletion**: Ensure data is properly deleted when no longer needed

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Require MFA for administrative access
- **Strong Password Policies**: Enforce complex passwords with regular rotation
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with proper timeouts
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Use RBAC to manage user permissions
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically review and update access permissions

## üéØ **Project-Specific Security Considerations**

### **Web Applications**
- **OWASP Top 10**: Address all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs on the server side
- **Output Encoding**: Encode outputs to prevent XSS attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **Content Security Policy**: Use CSP headers to prevent code injection

### **API Security**
- **API Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for API authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Validate all API inputs and parameters
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- **API Versioning**: Maintain secure API versioning practices

### **Mobile Applications**
- **Certificate Pinning**: Implement certificate pinning for API communications
- **Local Data Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data stored locally
- **Biometric Authentication**: Use device biometrics when available
- **App Transport Security**: Enforce secure network communications
- **Code Obfuscation**: Protect against reverse engineering

### **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **IAM Policies**: Implement least privilege IAM policies
- **Network Segmentation**: Use VPCs and security groups for isolation
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption for all cloud storage and databases
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Backup Security**: Secure and encrypt all backups

## üîç **Security Assessment Framework**

### **Risk Assessment Matrix**
| Risk Level | Impact | Likelihood | Response |
|------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Critical | High | High | Immediate action required |
| High | High | Medium | Address within 1 week |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | Address within 1 month |
| Low | Low | Low | Address in next release |

### **Security Testing Requirements**
- **Static Analysis**: Run SAST tools on all code
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Perform DAST testing on running applications
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security testing
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes

### **Compliance Frameworks**
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy requirements
- **CCPA**: California consumer privacy rights
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (if applicable)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data security (if applicable)
- **SOX**: Financial reporting controls (if applicable)

## üéØ **Implementation Notes**

These guidelines should be:
1. **Customized** for each project based on specific requirements
2. **Integrated** into the development lifecycle from the beginning
3. **Regularly reviewed** and updated based on new threats and technologies
4. **Enforced** through automated tools and manual processes
5. **Documented** with clear procedures and responsibilities

Security is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that requires continuous attention and improvement.
