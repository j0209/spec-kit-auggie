# Multi-AUGGIE Orchestration Guide
*Enhanced Spec-Kit Export with Parallel Development Coordination*

## Overview
This project includes advanced orchestration tools that enable multiple AUGGIE agents to work in parallel, coordinated through shared specifications and intelligent task management.

## Orchestration Architecture

### Agent Specializations
- **Setup Agent**: Project initialization, dependencies, tooling setup
- **Database Agent**: Schema design, models, migrations, data access
- **API Agent**: Endpoints, services, middleware, business logic
- **Frontend Agent**: Components, pages, styling, user interactions
- **Testing Agent**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E testing
- **Security Agent**: Authentication, authorization, security measures

### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Shared Specifications**: All agents reference the same context materials
- **Native Task Management**: AUGGIE's built-in task coordination
- **File Conflict Prevention**: Automatic detection and resolution
- **Dependency Enforcement**: Sequential execution of dependent tasks
- **Progress Synchronization**: Real-time status updates

## Quick Start Multi-Agent Development

### 1. Initialize Orchestration
```bash
# Setup multi-agent workspace
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh init

# This creates:
# - Individual agent workspaces
# - Shared specification context
# - Task assignment system
# - Conflict detection setup
```

### 2. Deploy Specialized Agents
```bash
# Option A: Full orchestration (recommended)
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh orchestrate

# Option B: Manual control
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh assign    # Assign tasks
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh execute   # Execute in parallel
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh status    # Monitor progress
```

### 3. Monitor Coordination
```bash
# Real-time status monitoring
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh status

# Output example:
# Multi-AUGGIE Status Report
# ==========================
# Tasks: 24 total, 2 pending, 0 assigned, 4 in progress, 18 completed, 0 failed
# 
# Active Agents:
# - Setup Agent: IDLE (completed T001-T005)
# - Database Agent: WORKING on T012 (Database Schema)
# - API Agent: WORKING on T015 (User Authentication API)
# - Frontend Agent: WORKING on T018 (Login Component)
# - Testing Agent: WORKING on T021 (Authentication Tests)
```

## Task Assignment Intelligence

### Automatic Assignment Logic
The orchestrator automatically assigns tasks based on:
1. **Specialization Match**: Agent expertise aligns with task requirements
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Prerequisites are completed first
3. **File Conflict Avoidance**: No two agents work on same files
4. **Parallel Safety**: Tasks marked `[P]` can run simultaneously
5. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across available agents

### Manual Task Control
```bash
# Assign specific task to specific agent
./.augment/orchestrator/assign-task.sh T015 api-agent

# Block task until dependencies complete
./.augment/orchestrator/block-task.sh T020 "waiting for T015,T018"

# Force sequential execution for critical tasks
./.augment/orchestrator/sequential-task.sh T025
```

## Parallel Execution Patterns

### Phase-Based Coordination
```
Phase 1: Setup (Sequential)
├── T001: Project initialization
├── T002: Dependency installation
└── T003: Development environment setup

Phase 2: Foundation (Limited Parallel)
├── T004: Database schema [P]
├── T005: API structure [P]
└── T006: Frontend scaffolding [P]

Phase 3: Implementation (Full Parallel)
├── Database Agent: T007-T012 (Models, migrations)
├── API Agent: T013-T018 (Endpoints, services)
├── Frontend Agent: T019-T024 (Components, pages)
└── Testing Agent: T025-T030 (Test suites)

Phase 4: Integration (Coordinated)
├── T031: API-Database integration
├── T032: Frontend-API integration
└── T033: End-to-end testing
```

### Conflict Prevention Strategies
- **File-Level Locking**: Prevent simultaneous edits to same files
- **Component Isolation**: Each agent works on distinct components
- **Shared Resource Coordination**: Database, config files managed sequentially
- **Integration Points**: Coordinated handoffs between agents

## Advanced Orchestration Features

### Dynamic Task Generation
```bash
# Generate additional tasks based on progress
./.augment/commands/auggie-tasks.sh "Additional API endpoints needed"

# Automatically integrate new tasks into coordination
./.augment/orchestrator/integrate-new-tasks.sh
```

### Specification Updates
```bash
# Update specifications during development
./.augment/commands/auggie-specify.sh "Refined requirements"

# Propagate changes to all agents
./.augment/orchestrator/sync-specifications.sh
```

### Quality Gates
```bash
# Automated quality checks between phases
./.augment/orchestrator/quality-gate.sh phase-2-complete

# Integration testing before final phase
./.augment/orchestrator/integration-check.sh
```

## Troubleshooting Multi-Agent Issues

### Common Coordination Problems

#### Task Conflicts
```bash
# Symptom: Multiple agents trying to modify same file
# Solution: Check parallel safety markers
./.augment/orchestrator/resolve-conflicts.sh

# Prevention: Better task decomposition
./.augment/commands/auggie-tasks.sh "Refine task boundaries"
```

#### Dependency Deadlocks
```bash
# Symptom: Circular dependencies blocking progress
# Solution: Analyze dependency graph
./.augment/orchestrator/analyze-dependencies.sh

# Resolution: Break circular dependencies
./.augment/orchestrator/break-deadlock.sh T015 T018
```

#### Agent Specialization Mismatches
```bash
# Symptom: Wrong agent assigned to task
# Solution: Reassign with correct specialization
./.augment/orchestrator/reassign-task.sh T020 frontend-agent
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Capacity**: Adjust based on system resources
- **Task Granularity**: Balance between coordination overhead and parallelism
- **Agent Efficiency**: Monitor and optimize agent performance
- **Resource Utilization**: Ensure optimal use of available agents

## Integration with AUGGIE Native Features

### Task Management Integration
- **Native Task Format**: All tasks use AUGGIE's built-in task management
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates through AUGGIE's task system
- **Dependency Management**: Leverages AUGGIE's dependency resolution
- **State Synchronization**: Automatic sync between agents

### Context Engine Utilization
- **Shared Context**: All agents access the same codebase context
- **Specification Awareness**: Context engine understands project specifications
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies reusable patterns across agents
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Maintains architectural consistency

## Best Practices

### Orchestration Setup
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 2-3 agents, scale up gradually
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Define clear component boundaries for each agent
3. **Shared Standards**: Establish coding standards and conventions
4. **Regular Sync**: Schedule regular coordination checkpoints

### Agent Coordination
1. **Specification Adherence**: All agents must follow the same specifications
2. **Communication Protocol**: Use shared task system for coordination
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Address conflicts immediately when detected
4. **Quality Consistency**: Maintain consistent quality across all agents

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task completion rates
2. **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify and resolve coordination bottlenecks
3. **Resource Optimization**: Optimize agent utilization
4. **Quality Metrics**: Track code quality and test coverage
