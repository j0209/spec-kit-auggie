# AUGGIE Development Guidelines
*Generated by Spec-Kit Enhanced Export*

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: {PROJECT_NAME}
**Technology Stack**: {TECH_STACK}
**Architecture**: {ARCHITECTURE_TYPE}
**Complexity Level**: {COMPLEXITY_LEVEL}

## Quick Start for AUGGIE Agents

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd {PROJECT_NAME}

# Initialize development environment
./.augment/workflows/setup-development.sh

# View available tasks
auggie view_tasklist
```

### 2. Agent Specialization Roles
- **Setup Agent**: Foundation tasks, dependencies, project structure
- **Database Agent**: Schema, models, migrations, data layer
- **API Agent**: Endpoints, services, business logic, middleware
- **Frontend Agent**: Components, pages, styling, user interactions
- **Testing Agent**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- **Security Agent**: Authentication, authorization, security measures

### 3. Task Coordination Protocol
```bash
# 1. Claim a task (prevents conflicts)
auggie update_tasks --task-id="T001" --state="IN_PROGRESS"

# 2. Reference relevant specifications
cat .augment/context/{relevant-spec}.md

# 3. Execute task following specifications
# [Implement according to spec]

# 4. Mark task complete
auggie update_tasks --task-id="T001" --state="COMPLETE"
```

## Context Materials Reference

### Core Specifications
- **Scope Specification**: `.augment/context/scope-spec.md` - Project boundaries and requirements
- **Design Specification**: `.augment/context/design-spec.md` - Visual design system
- **UX Specification**: `.augment/context/ux-spec.md` - User experience flows
- **Technical Specification**: `.augment/context/technical-spec.md` - Architecture details
- **Implementation Plan**: `.augment/context/plan.md` - Development strategy
- **Development Tasks**: `.augment/context/tasks.md` - Original task breakdown

### Specialized Specifications
- **API Specification**: `.augment/context/api-spec.md` - API contracts and endpoints
- **Database Specification**: `.augment/context/database-spec.md` - Data models and schema
- **Security Specification**: `.augment/context/security-spec.md` - Security requirements
- **Testing Specification**: `.augment/context/testing-spec.md` - Testing strategy

## Parallel Execution Guidelines

### Safe Parallel Tasks
Tasks marked with `[P]` can run simultaneously if they:
- Work on different files
- Don't share database resources
- Have no direct dependencies
- Don't modify shared configuration

### Conflict Prevention
```bash
# Check file conflicts before starting
./.augment/orchestrator/check-conflicts.sh T001 T002

# Use file locking for shared resources
./.augment/orchestrator/lock-file.sh src/config/database.js
```

### Coordination Patterns
- **Sequential Foundation**: Setup tasks must complete first
- **Parallel Implementation**: Core features can develop in parallel
- **Synchronized Integration**: Integration tasks require coordination
- **Parallel Testing**: Test suites can run independently

## AUGGIE Command Integration

### Available Commands
```bash
# Continue specification work
./.augment/commands/auggie-specify.sh "additional feature"
./.augment/commands/auggie-plan.sh "implementation details"
./.augment/commands/auggie-tasks.sh "new requirements"

# Specialized specifications
./.augment/commands/auggie-design-spec.sh "design updates"
./.augment/commands/auggie-ux-spec.sh "user flow improvements"
./.augment/commands/auggie-api-spec.sh "API enhancements"
```

### Context-Aware Execution
All commands automatically:
- Load project-specific context from `.augment/context/`
- Reference existing specifications and constraints
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- Update shared task coordination

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Orchestrator Usage
```bash
# Initialize multi-agent workspace
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh init

# Assign tasks to specialized agents
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh assign

# Execute tasks in parallel
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh orchestrate

# Monitor progress
./.augment/orchestrator/multi-auggie.sh status
```

### Agent Coordination
- **Shared Context**: All agents reference the same specifications
- **Task Dependencies**: Orchestrator enforces dependency order
- **File Conflicts**: Automatic detection and prevention
- **Progress Sync**: Real-time coordination between agents

## Development Workflows

### Standard Development Flow
1. **Setup Phase**: Initialize project structure and dependencies
2. **Foundation Phase**: Core architecture and data models
3. **Implementation Phase**: Parallel feature development
4. **Integration Phase**: Connect components and test integration
5. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive testing and validation
6. **Polish Phase**: Performance optimization and documentation

### Quality Assurance
- **Specification Compliance**: All code must align with specifications
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- **Code Quality**: Follow established patterns and conventions
- **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are implemented

{TECH_SPECIFIC_GUIDELINES}

### Dependencies Management
- Use package managers for all dependencies
- Follow semantic versioning
- Document dependency choices
- Regular security updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Task Conflicts**: Use orchestrator conflict detection
- **Specification Ambiguity**: Reference context materials
- **Integration Problems**: Follow integration workflows
- **Performance Issues**: Consult technical specifications

### Getting Help
- Review context materials in `.augment/context/`
- Check orchestrator logs for coordination issues
- Reference original specifications for clarification
- Use AUGGIE commands for continued planning
