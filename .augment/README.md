# SpecKit Development Task Management

This directory contains the task management system for the SpecKit project development.

## 📁 Files

- **`tasks.json`** - Complete task list with 5 main development areas and 20 subtasks
- **`task-manager.py`** - Python utility for managing task status and progress
- **`README.md`** - This documentation file

## 🎯 Task Overview

The development work is organized into 5 main areas:

### 1. **SPEC-001: Complete Core CLI Command Implementation** (High Priority)
- Add missing CLI commands (check, status, version)
- Improve error handling and validation  
- Enhance progress tracking system
- Add configuration management

### 2. **SPEC-002: Enhance AUGGIE Integration Bridge** (High Priority)
- Implement task conversion bridge
- Add real-time status synchronization
- Enhance AUGGIE command templates
- Implement approval gate system

### 3. **SPEC-003: Implement Multi-Project Management System** (Medium Priority)
- Build project metadata system
- Create project isolation framework
- Implement project discovery and listing
- Add project export and handoff system

### 4. **SPEC-004: Develop Template and Specification Engine** (Medium Priority)
- Complete specification templates
- Build template customization system
- Implement specification validation
- Create template versioning system

### 5. **SPEC-005: Build Testing and Quality Assurance Framework** (Medium Priority)
- Create unit test suite
- Implement integration tests
- Add workflow validation tests
- Implement quality gates and CI/CD

## 🚀 Using the Task Manager

### List all tasks with parallel/sequential markers:
```bash
python .augment/task-manager.py list
```

### Show execution plan with dependencies:
```bash
python .augment/task-manager.py plan
```

### Start working on a task:
```bash
python .augment/task-manager.py start SPEC-001-1
```

### Mark a task as completed:
```bash
python .augment/task-manager.py complete SPEC-001-1
```

### Get help:
```bash
python .augment/task-manager.py help
```

## 🔀 Parallel vs Sequential Execution

### Parallel Tasks `[P]` 🔀
- **Can run simultaneously** by different developers or AUGGIE agents
- **Independent files** - no conflicts expected
- **Marked with `[P]`** in task names
- **Examples**: Unit tests, template creation, documentation

### Sequential Tasks ➡️
- **Must run in order** due to dependencies
- **Shared files or dependencies** between tasks
- **Clear dependency chain** specified
- **Examples**: Foundation → Implementation → Integration

### Execution Phases
Tasks are organized into **execution phases**:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation tasks and parallel work
- **Phase 2**: Tasks dependent on Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 3**: Integration and final tasks

## 📊 Progress Tracking

- **Total Tasks**: 5 main tasks
- **Total Subtasks**: 20 detailed subtasks  
- **Estimated Hours**: 74 hours total
- **High Priority**: 2 tasks (Core CLI + AUGGIE Integration)
- **Medium Priority**: 3 tasks (Multi-Project + Templates + Testing)

## 🔄 Task Status & Symbols

### Task Status
- `not_started` - ⭕ Task not yet begun
- `in_progress` - 🔄 Currently being worked on
- `completed` - ✅ Task finished

### Execution Symbols
- `🔀` - Parallel execution (can run simultaneously)
- `➡️` - Sequential execution (must run in order)
- `[P]` - Parallel marker in task name
- `(deps: X, Y)` - Dependencies that must complete first

### Priority Indicators
- `🔥` - High priority (Core CLI + AUGGIE Integration)
- `📋` - Medium priority (Multi-Project + Templates + Testing)

## 💡 Integration with AUGGIE

These tasks are also available in AUGGIE's global task system. You can:

1. **Use AUGGIE's native task commands** for advanced task management
2. **Work on tasks directly in AUGGIE** using the task UUIDs
3. **Sync progress** between local and AUGGIE task systems

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Review the task list**: `python .augment/task-manager.py list`
2. **Pick a high-priority task**: Start with SPEC-001 or SPEC-002
3. **Start the task**: `python .augment/task-manager.py start SPEC-001-1`
4. **Work on the implementation** using the file paths provided
5. **Mark complete**: `python .augment/task-manager.py complete SPEC-001-1`

## 📝 Task Details

Each task includes:
- **Unique ID** for tracking
- **Clear description** of what needs to be done
- **File paths** indicating where to implement changes
- **Estimated hours** for planning purposes
- **Dependencies** and relationships to other tasks
